Stock news machine learning model that can determine if an news title is of interest to me. Uses spacy for entity extraction and sentiment analysis with a pycaret pretrained model.


Currently with my other tools I get news articles that

- are popular
- for specific stocks

I want to start scanning general stock news that

- general market sentiment
- strategies to train stocks
- accuquitions for other companies
- what the big hedge funds are doing

scan websites for news articles.

Eventually have a seperate model for reddit news

- label of interest if it contain financial terms or lingo or has implications of the financial sort.
